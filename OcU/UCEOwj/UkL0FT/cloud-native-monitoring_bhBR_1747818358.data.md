# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please follow the guidelines
below. Any pull requests opened that do not follow these guidelines
will not be reviewed.

## Pull Requests

### Branch Naming

We use a centralized single repository workflow with this Github
repository. This means that all development will take place in this
repository. In order to clarify and differenciate individual
development branches, all branches pushed to this repository must
start with the username or initials of the author. Example:
`tt/docker-integration` as opposed to `docker-integration`.

### Rebasing

Before a pull request is opened the commit history of that branch must
be squashed and cleaned. During the development process many git
commits may have taken place as the final branch was changed. This is
difficult to read through during the pull request review process and
even harder to understand at a later time when looking back through
too many commits. For this reason when a pull request is open it
should have no 'merge' commits where a branch was updated from
master. Instead [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) from an
updated master branch. In addition the many commits that are part of
the development process should be
[squashed](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
to larger, atomic, clear commits that clearly demonstrate the changes
in that branch.

### Issues

All pull requests should be linked to an issue. Issues are the places
where we can make sure that a change is needed and agree on the path
forward. A pull request without an existing issue can be a waster of
time for the author and the reviewer.

### Descriptions

Pull requests should be opened with a clear description of what change
is being made, to which files, for what reason and how a reviewer
might validate this change. In addition any related issues or other
pull requests should be linked in the description.
[This blog post](https://quickleft.com/blog/pull-request-templates-make-code-review-easier/)
describes a pull request template and workflow that accomplishes these
goals. While we do not require this template, you may find it helpful
in organizing your pull request.

## Commits

Commits are the way that we quickly communicate exactly which changes
happened, where they happened and why. This is difficult to do in a
short message in a log of commits. In order to have the most clear and
readable commits we use the following rules:

* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

The first three of these are always applicable. The imperative mood
means that all commit subject lines should start with words like
'Remove', 'Add', 'Refactor' and 'Fix'. While a commit message body is
not always required it can be helpful in further explaining a
complicated change. These rules are taken from
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
